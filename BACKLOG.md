## Feature Summary

### P0 — Core MVP (must ship before launch)

**01 · Next.js Scaffold + DB Schema**
- Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Prisma schema: User, Exam, ChallengeSet, Question, Attempt, MockAttempt
- DB migration + Claude Architect seed (≥ 20 questions, ≥ 3 challenge sets)

**02 · Auth & Role-Based Access**
- Register / login / logout / silent refresh
- JWT in httpOnly cookies (access 15min, refresh 7 days)
- Two roles: `admin`, `candidate`
- Next.js middleware guards routes by role

**03 · Exam Catalog & Flashcard Flow**
- Browse exams → pick challenge set → answer flashcards
- Animated FlashCard component with per-answer feedback + explanation
- Submit attempt, earn XP on completion
- Mobile-first cartoony card UI

**04 · Timed Mock Exam Mode**
- Full randomized exam, countdown timer
- Auto-submit on expiry; server validates time
- Post-exam review showing all answers
- Score saved to MockAttempt; feeds readiness %

**05 · Progress Dashboard & Gamification**
- Readiness % gauge: `(avgChallengeScore × 0.5) + (bestMockScore × 0.5)`
- Cumulative XP bar
- Weak topics list, challenge + mock exam history
- 3 milestone badges (first attempt, 50% ready, all challenges done)

### P1 — Launch completers

**06 · Admin Panel**
- `/admin` section, role-gated to ADMIN
- CRUD: exams, challenge sets, questions (MCQ + true/false)
- Question editor with options, correct answer, explanation

**07 · PWA Offline Support**
- `next-pwa` service worker (Workbox)
- Offline challenge play: answers queued in IndexedDB
- Sync to `/api/attempts/sync` on reconnect
- Offline indicator UI

**08 · Docker + Caddy + Cloudflare Tunnel**
- Docker Compose: Next.js app + PostgreSQL + Caddy
- Caddyfile reverse proxy config
- Cloudflare Tunnel via env var token
- README: setup, seed, tunnel config

| CSV bulk question import | ✅ Done | Admin uploads CSV; server parses + upserts |
| PDF score report export | ✅ Done | Candidate downloads readiness summary |
| Team/cohort manager view | | "8/10 team members ≥ 80% ready" dashboard |
| Additional exam catalogs | | AWS SAA, Azure AZ-900, Scrum PSM-I |
| Leaderboard | | Opt-in XP ranking within cohort |
| Email notifications | | Weekly readiness summary email |
| CI/CD pipeline | | GitHub Actions → Docker Hub → self-hosted deploy |
| User management (admin) | | Invite, suspend, role-change |

## Architecture

```
Cloudflare Tunnel
  └── Caddy (TLS + reverse proxy)
        └── Next.js app (App Router + API Routes)
              └── PostgreSQL (via Prisma)
```

**Key tech decisions:**
- Next.js API routes replace separate Express backend — less ops overhead
- Prisma handles migrations + type-safe queries
- `next-pwa` / Workbox for service worker — integrates cleanly with Next.js build
- IndexedDB for offline attempt queue (not localStorage — structured data, larger quota)
- JWT in httpOnly cookies — XSS-safe token storage
