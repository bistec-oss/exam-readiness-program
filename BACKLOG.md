## Feature Summary

### P0 — Core MVP (must ship before launch)

**01 · Next.js Scaffold + DB Schema**
- Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Prisma schema: User, Exam, ChallengeSet, Question, Attempt, MockAttempt
- DB migration + Claude Architect seed (≥ 20 questions, ≥ 3 challenge sets)

**02 · Auth & Role-Based Access**
- Register / login / logout / silent refresh
- JWT in httpOnly cookies (access 15min, refresh 7 days)
- Two roles: `admin`, `candidate`
- Next.js middleware guards routes by role

**03 · Exam Catalog & Flashcard Flow**
- Browse exams → pick challenge set → answer flashcards
- Animated FlashCard component with per-answer feedback + explanation
- Submit attempt, earn XP on completion
- Mobile-first cartoony card UI

**04 · Timed Mock Exam Mode**
- Full randomized exam, countdown timer
- Auto-submit on expiry; server validates time
- Post-exam review showing all answers
- Score saved to MockAttempt; feeds readiness %

**05 · Progress Dashboard & Gamification**
- Readiness % gauge: `(avgChallengeScore × 0.5) + (bestMockScore × 0.5)`
- Cumulative XP bar
- Weak topics list, challenge + mock exam history
- 3 milestone badges (first attempt, 50% ready, all challenges done)

### P1 — Launch completers

**06 · Admin Panel**
- `/admin` section, role-gated to ADMIN
- CRUD: exams, challenge sets, questions (MCQ + true/false)
- Question editor with options, correct answer, explanation

**07 · PWA Offline Support**
- `next-pwa` service worker (Workbox)
- Offline challenge play: answers queued in IndexedDB
- Sync to `/api/attempts/sync` on reconnect
- Offline indicator UI

**08 · Docker + Caddy + Cloudflare Tunnel**
- Docker Compose: Next.js app + PostgreSQL + Caddy
- Caddyfile reverse proxy config
- Cloudflare Tunnel via env var token
- README: setup, seed, tunnel config

**14 · Landing Page — Browse Exam Catalog**
- Public `/` route serves the exam catalog (anonymous visitors see all 4 exams)
- `/exams` remains the logged-in equivalent (keeps Dashboard back-link)
- Shared `components/ExamCatalog.tsx` keeps both routes DRY
- "Sign in" / "Register" CTAs in top-right header for anonymous visitors
- Action buttons (clicking exam cards) redirect to `/login` for anonymous users

## Post-MVP Backlog

| Feature | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| ✅ CSV bulk question import | Admin uploads/pastes CSV; server parses + validates + bulk-creates. `/admin/questions` UI + `POST /api/admin/questions/import` |
| ✅ PDF score report export | Candidate downloads readiness summary PDF via `GET /api/progress/report` (dependency-free generator) |
| ✅ Team/cohort manager view | "8/10 team members ≥ 80% ready" dashboard |
| ✅ Additional exam catalogs | AWS SAA, Azure AZ-900, Scrum PSM-I |
| ✅ Leaderboard | Opt-in XP ranking within cohort. `/leaderboard` page + `GET /api/leaderboard` (cohort-scoped, opted-in only), opt-in toggle via `PATCH /api/me/preferences` |
| ✅ Email notifications | Weekly readiness summary email. Admin `POST /api/notifications/weekly` generates per-user summaries (persisted to `EmailLog`), candidate inbox at `/settings` + `GET /api/notifications`, opt-out via `PATCH /api/me/preferences` |
| ✅ CI/CD pipeline | GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`): lint+build+e2e → build & push image to Docker Hub → SSH deploy to self-hosted host. Gated jobs, deploy on main push only |
| ✅ User management (admin) | `/admin/users` page + `/api/admin/users` (list/invite) + `PATCH /api/admin/users/[id]` (role-change, suspend/reactivate). Invite returns temp password; suspended users blocked at login; self-lockout guard |

## Architecture

```
Cloudflare Tunnel
  └── Caddy (TLS + reverse proxy)
        └── Next.js app (App Router + API Routes)
              └── PostgreSQL (via Prisma)
```

**Key tech decisions:**
- Next.js API routes replace separate Express backend — less ops overhead
- Prisma handles migrations + type-safe queries
- `next-pwa` / Workbox for service worker — integrates cleanly with Next.js build
- IndexedDB for offline attempt queue (not localStorage — structured data, larger quota)
- JWT in httpOnly cookies — XSS-safe token storage
